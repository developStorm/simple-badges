## What is this?
Simple Badges is a fork of the [original](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons-website) Simple Icons website, which made a combination of original icons with multiple styles of [Shields IO](https://shields.io/) badges to help you to find your favorite badges in a easy way.

## Where can I use this?
I've seen people use Shields.IO badges for various scenarios, the most common one is use it for your GitHub [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) to showcase your skills ![JS](https://shields-staging-pr-6591.herokuapp.com/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square), your software ![Android](https://shields-staging-pr-6591.herokuapp.com/badge/Android-3DDC84?logo=android&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square) or even things you like ![Minecraft](https://shields-staging-pr-6591.herokuapp.com/badge/Minecraft-62B47A?logo=minecraft&logoColor=fff&style=flat-square). 

However, that is certainly not its only use. **Be creative!**

## How to use this?
1. Search the badge you want
2. Choice a style of badge to copy its URL
3. Link the image wherein you wish!

**That's it!** You can check [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for details about adding image to your README.
